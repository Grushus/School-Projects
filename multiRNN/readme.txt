School project focused on OOP and MultiRNN
Splits a dataset into x datasets for x columns in dataset
So let us say a dataset has 15 columns. This dataset will then be split
and 15 other dataset with each column will be created
After that a model for each column or new dataset will be built
From that point onwards there are functions allowing you to: predict each new dataset,
plot the predict versus the original unsplit dataset, plot loss and val loss per column,
forecast values for the dataset and plot the forecast.

The goal behind this project was to reduce the time it takes for large datasets to get tested
Now you can instead test whichever individual column you please
